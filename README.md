# stickeiya ✨
a WhatsApp bot that converts images into stickers built with [baileys](https://baileys.whiskeysockets.io/). yes, the name comes from `sticker + eiya`.

## just... why? 🤔
okay, so... a few months ago, i made [kyu](https://github.com/eiyaxz/kyu-bot), which was not bad at all, but had a really annoying issue when it came to performance. it required around 500MB of ram, which was way past what i could offer with my hosting service budget. so, to solve that issue, i came across baileys, which made the bot only require **less than 50MB** of ram. it's crazy.

kyu's main reason to exist was because the bot i used to use stopped working, so i just made mine.

## features 🧐
- image, video and gif conversion to sticker
- why does this only have one feature :(

## okay... how do i use it? 😯
1. first, clone the repository on your machine using `git clone https://github.com/eiyaxz/stickeiya.git`.
2. install the project's dependencies using `npm install`.
3. run `npm run start` and link your device using the QR code that's going to appear on your terminal. [click here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=web) if you don't know how to link a device.
4. that's it! now you have a bot in your WhatsApp account.

## may i contribute? 🤓
sure! just fork the project and open a PR and i will analyze it myself. i appreciate the help!

## anything else? 😥
no. thanks for reading!
